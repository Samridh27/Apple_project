## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project was to leverage SQL for a comprehensive analysis of Apple's business operations. By combining data from different domains—sales, products, and warranty—I aimed to provide actionable insights for business decision-making. The project addresses questions related to sales performance, product trends, store efficiency, and warranty claim patterns.

This project uses SQL to analyze a multi-faceted dataset of Apple's sales, products, stores, and warranty claims. It uncovers key business insights and showcases my proficiency in data manipulation and querying.
